# Object-Recognintion

Build an “auto” detector using Faster RCNN/YOLO based methods (one of the above)

Auto image data as a starting point, feel free to add or use any other data, or annotate this data (notes folder)

Document where the method works well or fails

Trained the Yolo and the Faster RCNN models to detect autos in testing images given as input. Autos do not include cars, bikes, buses or trucks. Only autorickshaws will be detected in the test images
